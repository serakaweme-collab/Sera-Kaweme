QUESTION 1: WEBSITE CREATION

I would create a Green Zambia Organization website using only HTML. The purpose of the site is to promote environmental sustainability, renewable energy, and conservation efforts in Zambia.

Content and Structure:
Homepage: Introduction to Green Zambia Organization with logo and mission statement.
Mission Section: Clear explanation of the organization’s goals—tree planting, renewable energy, conservation.
Projects Section: Articles describing initiatives such as solar energy programs and community awareness campaigns.
Impact Table: A table showing focus areas (renewable energy, conservation, community engagement) and their impacts.
Contact Section: A form where visitors can send inquiries or volunteer applications.
Footer: Copyright and organizational details.

Semantic HTML Usage:
<header> for the logo and navigation.
<section> for mission, projects, and contact.
<article> for individual project descriptions.
<footer> for closing information.
  
Elements and Attributes:
Over 25 elements including:
<html> <head> <meta> <title> <body> <header> <h1> <section> <h2> <p> <img> <article> <h3> <table> <caption> <form> <label> <footer> <nav> <ul> <li> <a> <img> <form> <input> <textarea> <table> <caption> <tr> <th> <td>
•	At least 15 attributes such as;
href, title, id, src, alt, width, height, border, action, method, for, type, required, placeholder, rows, cols, value
This ensures the site is functional, accessible, and well-structured while meeting the assignment requirements.

Question 2: HTML Elements
1.	Most challenging elements:
o	<form>: Handling input fields and ensuring proper structure.
o	<table>: Organizing rows and columns neatly.
o	<audio>: Embedding audio with fallback options.
o	<video>: Managing controls and multiple formats.
o	<figure> with <figcaption> – presenting project images with descriptive captions.
o	<iframe>: Integrating external content without breaking layout.
  
2.	Use of semantic elements:
o	<header>: Placed at the top with navigation links.
o	<section>: Divided content into logical parts (About, Projects, Contact).
o	<article>: Used for blog posts or project descriptions.
o	<footer>: Contained copyright and contact details.

3.	Most useful element for layout:
<section> was the most useful because it allowed clear separation of content areas, making the site more organized and easier to read.

  Question 3: HTML Attributes
1.	Essential attributes: 
o	href (used in <a>): Enabled navigation between pages and external links.
o	src (used in <img>, <video>, <audio>): Made multimedia functional by linking to files.
o	alt (used in <img>): Ensured accessibility and provided fallback descriptions.

  These attributes were crucial for making the website interactive, accessible, and functional.

  2.	Class vs. Id usage:
•	Class: Used for styling multiple elements consistently (e.g., project cards, article blocks).
•	Id: Used for unique identifiers like navigation anchors (id="projects").
3.	Attribute improving user experience most:
•	alt in <img> because it ensures accessibility and provides context when images don’t load, especially important for visually impaired users.
Question 4: Development Process
1.	Planning: I outlined the site map with sections (Home, About, Projects, News, Contact) before coding.
2.	Testing & Debugging: I used browser developer tools to check rendering, validated HTML with W3C validator, and corrected nesting errors.
3.	Challenges:
o	Structuring project statistics in tables → solved by reviewing table syntax.
o	Embedding multimedia → solved by using proper attributes (controls, autoplay, loop).
o	Ensuring accessibility → solved by adding alt, label, and title attributes.
Question 5: Git & GitHub Implementation
1.	Git commands used:
o	git init, git add ., git commit -m "message", git push origin main.
2.	Commits: Around 12 commits, each with descriptive messages like "Added volunteer form" or "Updated projects section".
3.	Importance of version control: It tracks changes, prevents data loss, and allows collaboration with instructors and peers.
Question 6: Code Quality & Best Practices
1.	Ensuring valid HTML: Used W3C validator and corrected errors.
2.	Best practices followed:
o	Proper indentation and nesting.
o	Semantic tags for clarity.
o	Descriptive commit messages.
o	README.md documentation.
3.	Improvements with more time:
o	Add responsive design with CSS.
o	Include interactive maps of project locations.
o	Expand multimedia content with more videos and podcasts.
