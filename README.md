## Question 1: Website Creation
I created a **Green Zambia Organization website** to promote environmental awareness, sustainability projects, and community initiatives in Zambia.  

**Content includes:**
- **Homepage:** Introduction to Green Zambia Organization and its mission.  
- **About Section:** Background, vision, and objectives of the organization.  
- **Projects Section:** Details of ongoing environmental projects (tree planting, recycling, renewable energy).  
- **News & Articles Section:** Updates on environmental campaigns and educational articles.  
- **Contact Section:** Email, phone, and social media links for community engagement.  
- **Footer:** Copyright, navigation links, and acknowledgments.

## Question 2: HTML Elements
1. **Most challenging elements:**
   - `<form>` – creating a functional volunteer sign-up form.  
   - `<table>` – organizing project statistics (trees planted, communities reached).  
   - `<audio>` – embedding environmental awareness podcasts.  
   - `<video>` – showcasing project documentaries.  
   - `<figure>` with `<figcaption>` – presenting project images with descriptive captions.  

2. **Semantic elements usage:**  
   - `<header>` for the organization’s logo and navigation menu.  
   - `<section>` for grouping content (About, Projects, News, Contact).  
   - `<article>` for individual news stories and project updates.  
   - `<footer>` for closing notes, copyright, and external links.  

3. **Most useful element for layout:**  
   - `<section>` because it allowed clear separation of organizational content, making the site easy to navigate.

## Question 3: HTML Attributes
1. **Essential attributes:**  
   - `href` in `<a>` for linking to project pages and external resources.  
   - `src` in `<img>` for displaying project photos.  
   - `type` in `<input>` for correct volunteer form functionality.  

2. **Class vs. Id usage:**  
   - **Class:** Used for styling multiple elements consistently (e.g., project cards, article blocks).  
   - **Id:** Used for unique identifiers like navigation anchors (`id="projects"`).  

3. **Attribute improving user experience most:**  
   - `alt` in `<img>` because it ensures accessibility and provides context when images don’t load, especially important for visually impaired users.

## Question 4: Development Process
1. **Planning:** I outlined the site map with sections (Home, About, Projects, News, Contact) before coding.  
2. **Testing & Debugging:** I used browser developer tools to check rendering, validated HTML with W3C validator, and corrected nesting errors.  
3. **Challenges:**  
   - Structuring project statistics in tables → solved by reviewing table syntax.  
   - Embedding multimedia → solved by using proper attributes (`controls`, `autoplay`, `loop`).  
   - Ensuring accessibility → solved by adding `alt`, `label`, and `title` attributes.

## Question 5: Git & GitHub Implementation
1. **Git commands used:**  
   - `git init`, `git add .`, `git commit -m "message"`, `git push origin main`.  
2. **Commits:** Around 12 commits, each with descriptive messages like `"Added volunteer form"` or `"Updated projects section"`.  
3. **Importance of version control:** It tracks changes, prevents data loss, and allows collaboration with instructors and peers.

## Question 6: Code Quality & Best Practices
1. **Ensuring valid HTML:** Used W3C validator and corrected errors.  
2. **Best practices followed:**  
   - Proper indentation and nesting.  
   - Semantic tags for clarity.  
   - Descriptive commit messages.  
   - README.md documentation.  
3. **Improvements with more time:**  
   - Add responsive design with CSS.  
   - Include interactive maps of project locations.  
   - Expand multimedia content with more videos and podcasts.
