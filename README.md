# 🌍 Green Zambia Organization Website

## Overview
This project is a semantic HTML-only website designed to promote **environmental sustainability, renewable energy, and conservation efforts in Zambia**. It highlights the mission, projects, and impact of the Green Zambia Organization while ensuring accessibility and clean structure.

## Content & Structure
- **Homepage**: Introduction with logo and mission statement.
- **Mission Section**: Clear explanation of goals (tree planting, renewable energy, conservation).
- **Projects Section**: Articles describing initiatives such as solar energy programs and community awareness campaigns.
- **Impact Table**: Displays focus areas (renewable energy, conservation, community engagement) and their impacts.
- **Contact Section**: Form for inquiries and volunteer applications.
- **Footer**: Copyright and organizational details.

## Semantic HTML Usage
- `<header>`: Logo and navigation.
- `<section>`: Mission, projects, and contact.
- `<article>`: Individual project descriptions.
- `<footer>`: Closing information.

## Elements & Attributes
- **Elements (25+)**: `<html>`, `<head>`, `<meta>`, `<title>`, `<body>`, `<header>`, `<h1>`, `<section>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`, `<img>`, `<article>`, `<h3>`, `<table>`, `<caption>`, `<form>`, `<label>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<a>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, `<td>`
- **Attributes (15+)**: `href`, `title`, `id`, `src`, `alt`, `width`, `height`, `border`, `action`, `method`, `for`, `type`, `required`, `placeholder`, `rows`, `cols`, `value`

## Development Process
- **Planning**: Site map with sections (Home, About, Projects, News, Contact).
- **Testing & Debugging**: Browser developer tools, W3C validator, corrected nesting errors.
- **Challenges Solved**:
  - Table structuring → reviewed syntax.
  - Multimedia embedding → applied attributes (`controls`, `autoplay`, `loop`).
  - Accessibility → added `alt`, `label`, and `title`.

## Git & GitHub Implementation
- **Commands Used**: `git init`, `git add .`, `git commit -m "message"`, `git push origin main`
- **Commits**: ~12 commits with descriptive messages (e.g., "Added volunteer form", "Updated projects section").
- **Version Control Importance**: Tracks changes, prevents data loss, enables collaboration.

## Code Quality & Best Practices
- Validated HTML with W3C validator.
- Proper indentation and nesting.
- Semantic tags for clarity.
- Descriptive commit messages.
- README.md documentation.

## Future Improvements
- Add responsive design with CSS.
- Include interactive maps of project locations.
- Expand multimedia content (videos, podcasts).
